# **CVE Agent Technical Assessment - Understanding Your Environment**

## **Purpose**
This questionnaire helps us understand the diversity and characteristics of your development environment so we can design the most effective CVE agent solution. Rather than assuming what your environment looks like, we want to build something that works well with your actual infrastructure, processes, and team practices.

**Our Goal**: Build the right solution for your environment by understanding your current landscape.

## **Assessment Questions**

### **1. Development Environment Landscape**

#### **Language & Repository Distribution**
- What programming languages make up your application portfolio and roughly what percentage of repositories use each? (Java, Node.js, Python, .NET, Go, etc.)
- How many repositories are monorepos vs microservice repos vs traditional single-application repos?
- How many repositories contain multiple languages or frameworks within the same codebase?

#### **Testing Infrastructure**
- Across your repository portfolio, what percentage would you estimate have comprehensive automated test suites (>80% coverage)?
- What percentage have moderate test coverage (50-80%)?  
- What percentage have limited or minimal automated testing (<50%)?
- Which testing frameworks are commonly considered standard across your teams?

#### **Build & CI/CD Systems**
- What CI/CD platforms are used across your repositories? (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Do you have API access to WIZ, Checkmarx, and Nexus IQ for vulnerability data retrieval?
- What deployment patterns do you see most often? (blue-green, canary, rolling deployments, direct deployment)

#### **Release Cycles & Validation**
- How do release frequencies vary across teams? (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- What validation steps are typically required before production deployment?
- How much regression testing is standard practice vs optional?
- What are your typical rollback procedures and approval processes?

## **Why These Questions Help Us**

### **Understanding Language Diversity**
Different programming languages and frameworks require different approaches for vulnerability remediation:
- **Build System Integration**: Different languages require different validation approaches for dependency management and testing
- **Dependency Management**: Each ecosystem has unique dependency resolution and update patterns  
- **Testing Frameworks**: Validation approaches need to work with your standard testing tools
- **Toolchain Support**: Our solution needs to work across your actual technology stack

### **Assessing Testing Infrastructure Maturity**
Testing infrastructure directly impacts what we can automate safely:

**Why Testing Matters for AI-Generated Patches**:
LLMs can generate code that compiles perfectly but breaks business logic in subtle ways. They might:
- Fix a security vulnerability but change algorithm behavior
- Update a dependency but break integration contracts
- Modify method implementations while maintaining signatures
- Introduce edge case failures that only surface in production

**Different Testing Levels Enable Different Approaches**:
- **Comprehensive Testing (>80% coverage)**: Enables high automation with confidence
- **Moderate Testing (50-80%)**: Allows selective automation with targeted validation
- **Limited Testing (<50%)**: Requires more manual review and careful human oversight

### **CI/CD Integration Patterns**
Understanding your current automation helps us integrate smoothly:
- **Pipeline Integration**: How to plug into existing workflows without disruption
- **Security API Access**: Ability to retrieve vulnerability data programmatically from your scanning tools
- **Validation Gates**: Work with existing approval and testing processes
- **Deployment Integration**: Align with current deployment practices

### **Release Cycle Considerations**
Release patterns help us design appropriate automation levels:
- **Frequent Releases**: May benefit from higher automation to reduce bottlenecks  
- **Careful Release Cycles**: May prefer more human oversight and validation steps
- **Validation Requirements**: Need to align with existing UAT and regression testing
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Influence how confident we can be with automated changes

## **What This Assessment Enables**

### **Solution Customization**
- **Technology-Specific Integration**: Build validation that works with your actual tools and frameworks
- **Risk-Appropriate Automation**: Match automation levels to repository maturity and risk tolerance  
- **Workflow Integration**: Plug into existing processes rather than requiring new ones
- **Scalable Approach**: Design for your actual repository diversity, not theoretical perfect environments

### **Implementation Strategy**
Based on your responses, we can design a solution that:
- **Maximizes Automation** where your infrastructure supports it (repos with good testing, modern CI/CD)
- **Provides Safety Guards** where more caution is needed (legacy repos, limited testing)
- **Integrates Smoothly** with your existing tools, processes, and team practices
- **Scales Appropriately** across the spectrum of repository maturity in your environment

### **Realistic Expectations**
Understanding your environment helps set appropriate expectations for:
- **What can be fully automated** vs what requires human review
- **How much human effort reduction** is realistic given your current testing infrastructure  
- **What improvements in speed and consistency** are achievable
- **Where additional investment** in testing infrastructure would unlock higher automation

## **Next Steps**

1. **Environment Assessment**: Review and respond to the questions based on your current state
2. **Solution Design**: We'll design an approach that matches your actual environment
3. **Implementation Planning**: Create a roadmap that works with your infrastructure and processes
4. **Success Criteria**: Define realistic metrics for improvement based on your starting point

This collaborative approach ensures we build something that provides real value within your current constraints while identifying opportunities for even greater automation as your infrastructure evolves.
