# BPMN Validator Agent - Phase 1 Requirements
# Core LLM and MCP dependencies

# You'll need to adapt these based on your actual LlmAgent framework
# This is based on the pattern you showed in your example

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
# Assuming you have a custom framework or using one of these:
# - Google ADK framework from your project
# - Custom LlmAgent implementation

# Core Python dependencies
requests>=2.31.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# XML processing for BPMN files
lxml>=4.9.0
xmltodict>=0.13.0

# JSON processing and utilities
jsonschema>=4.17.0

# Path and file utilities (built-in but listed for clarity)
pathlib2>=2.3.7

# Optional: If using OpenAI/Anthropic as fallback
# openai>=1.0.0
# anthropic>=0.18.0

# Development and testing
pytest>=7.0.0
black>=23.0.0
flake8>=6.0.0

# Ollama client (if needed for direct API calls)
ollama>=0.1.0

# MCP server dependencies (these are typically installed via npx)
# @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
# @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

# Note: The main LlmAgent framework and MCPToolset classes
# appear to be part of your custom Google ADK project at:
# /Users/srirajkadimisetty/projects/uv-projects/adk-first-project
#
# You may need to add that project to your Python path or
# install it as a local package:
# pip install -e /Users/srirajkadimisetty/projects/uv-projects/adk-first-project
